    review: `Was struggling for months with my business and for the longest Steve and Miguel have offered my some deals and I was hesitant on doing business with them but I took a good leap of faith allowed them to structure me something that would work in my favor. I was able to get out of the place I was stuck at and my business is now back up and running Thanks to both Steve and his boss Miguel for not giving up on me and allowing me to taken my time on making the right decision for my business.

    review: `I contacted Solidify through a friend of mine who was recently approved by them. I initially made contact with Nelson, who was very polite as well as eager to help. He explained everything about how they worked and what could be expected, to which I agreed. Shortly thereafter, Miguel, Nelson's partner, contacted me. He told me how he and Nelson were working together on my business to get me funded. Miguel advised me what would happen at each step, line upon line, which it did. The customer service I received from both of them was exceptional, and that is extremely important to me. Payback terms and other information were explained to me in detail before I took any action. After hearing and agreeing to everything, I signed the required documents and was funded about 48 hours after initial contact. This is the kind of service I hope for and expect when conducting business. I would recommend this company and these 2 gentlemen to anyone.

    review: `I found Solidify got a quote for a loan and shopped around for a few weeks but ended up coming back to them cause they offered the best deal for a business loan. The representatives I worked with went above and beyond to help me get the best deal possible.  I would definitely recommend them. I was very satisfied with how quick the funding was transferred to my bank account once all the paper work was signed.

    review: `During my experience with working with Solidify USA, I can say I dealt with one of the most professional team in the industry. Miguel especially. He explained every step of the process and handled all questions I had. Even when he wasnâ€™t in the office, the lines of communication were open. Made the process smooth as could be. Definitely recommend dealing with Miguel and Solidify.
